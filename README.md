You want to share your bike route with the whole world? ‘Bike Trip’ is here to help you with that!

All bike trips are shared in a form of post, which can be seen by everybody. 
Each ‘trip’ will have all the information you need to try it out by yourself: map, duration, complexity level, images and more. 

Find yourself a trip, ask the guy who created if you have specific question, comment, and rate the trip after you have tried it out, create your own collection of favorite trips, and finally, tell you own story to other travelers!
