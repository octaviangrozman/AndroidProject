Have you had a splendid bike trip last weekend? Was the route you picked gorgeous and unforgettable? Do you want to share your bike route with the whole world? ‘Bike Trip’ is here to help you with that!

Bike Trip application is a place where people create and share bike trips. All bike trips are shared in a form of a post, which can be seen by everybody. Each ‘trip’ will have all the information you need to try it out by yourself: map, duration, complexity level, images and more.

Find yourself a trip, ask the guy who created if you have a specific question, comment, and rate the trip after you have tried it out, create your own collection of favourite trips, and finally, tell your own story to other travellers!

The BikeTrip's code is built in Android and it is intended to be used as a mobile application. The application gives us a multi-user experience. All the data is persistent thanks to the Firebase real-time database. The application implements a convenient map interface so that you can easily share your routes.
